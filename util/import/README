Scripts and related files for importing data from the old FoxPro database.

    foxpro_parser.pl
        A utility that parses FoxPro formatted dumps of the legacy CGC
        database and produces tab-delimited files that can be imported into
        the new relational database.

    import.pl
        Loads a set of expected files and populates the relational CGC
        database. The script operates on an input directory that contains
        converted FoxPro dumps and other custom data. Since data in individual
        tables in the new schema potentially draws from multiple import files,
        the files are read in together. The script uses the DBIx::Schema model
        framework to interact (i.e., insert) the data into the database.
