Menu bar:
* Typeahead isn't working from the global search menu. Should it be?
* The global search menu doesn't work.
* The home link doesn't go home. Do we even need this?
* The search returns an empty record if searching for things that have no hits (n1159;

Basic/Advanced searching
-------------------------
1. I simplified the home page so that it only displays the global search (as per Aric's many requests, even though I no likey)
2. The faceted "Advanced Search" doesn't work for the various categories. Should we just have a page
   with links to the different types of searches instead?
3. From the advanced search, the link back to "Basic Search" doesn't work.




Cart popup:
