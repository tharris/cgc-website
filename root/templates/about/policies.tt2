  <h1>WormBase Policies</h1>

   <h2><a name="acceptable-use"></a>Acceptable Use Policy</h2>
<p>
Drafted: 08 January 2005
</p>
<h3>Data access policy</h3>
<p>
As a web-based resource, WormBase (http://www.wormbase.org) is designed for users interacting with the resource on a page-by-page basis.
</p>
<p>
Users wishing to automate data retrieval from WormBase should direct their scripts to the data mining server (mining.wormbase.org) instead of the primary WormBase server.
</p>
<p>
aceserver.cshl.org always hosts an up-to-date copy of the database and the software that drives WormBase. In addition, the underlying databases at aceserver (Acedb and the Mysql GFF databases) are available for programmatic access (see Mining via AcePerl and Mining via MySQL for examples).
</p>
<p>
In consideration of other users, we request that any script -- whether it be mining the web interface or directly interacting with the underlying databases -- send no more than one request every three seconds.
</p>
<p>
If these facilities do not provide adequate speed for your needs, you may download and install the database locally. For additional help, please contact help@wormbase.org.
</p>

<h3>In-line citations</h3>
<p>
We do our best to correctly annotate and cite sources when available. Users are encouraged to confirm these citations independently. Absence of a citation from WormBase does not imply that an appropriate citation does not exist.
