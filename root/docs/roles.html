Role-based Authorization

The role-based authorization built into the app lets us easily
provide different views based on the status of the user. Here's
how it works.

Available Roles:

* admin 
  App developers. Have full privileges plus dashboard panels
  for debugging and performance tuning.

* manager 
  A senior user, such as a principal investigator. Managers 
  have access to reporting and statistics.

* employee
  A semi-privileged member of the business or lab. Employees can
  enter and edit data.

* users 
  End users. Can create an account for themself and place order.


Where are roles defined?

* schema/cgc.sql


How are the ancestral admin users specified?

* During database creation in schema/cgc.sql
* Dynamically based on specific email addresses in App::Web::Controller::Auth.


How do I make use of roles in templates to conditionally display content?

    [% IF c.check_user_role('admin') %]
         You're awesome, admin! Have an awesome day, m'kay?
    [% END %]


What else?
Checkout Catalyst::Plugin::Authorization::Role for additional cool stuff. 
For example, we may want to restrict by role access to specific actions.
