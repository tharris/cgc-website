The templates in this directory are responsible for BOTH
class report pages 

    /species/c_elegans/gene/WBGene0000001

and the species summary pages

   /species/all and /species/c_elegans


report.tt2: Sets up the page. You should NOT need to edit this.

For the species summary pages:
--------------------------------
The directories like all/ and {SPECIES_NAME}/ contain custom
widgets that are generated programmatically and/or that require
Template::Toolkit code.  ALL OTHER WIDGETS ARE CREATED VIA THE WEB
INTERFACE.

Actions are found in W::W::Controller::Species.
