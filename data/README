LabList:

Attached is the database we call Lablist.  It is a list of all labs registered with us and when they paid their lab fee.  I added a line at the top labeling each column.

This database contains the location and freeze dates of strains in the freezers.



Correspondence from Aric:

I was out on Friday, so just got your email this morning.  I will get the remaining databases to you ASAP.  For the strains database, it might be a bit more complicated.  It has a separate window with the strain description.  If I cannot export that in the same format as the others, you might want to try using the huge text file on our website (http://www.cbs.umn.edu/CGC/strains/gophstrnt.txt) that Mary Ann uses to update Wormbase.  It should contain the same information.
