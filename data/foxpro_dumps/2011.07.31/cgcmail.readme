Hi Todd,

Here is the file we call CGC MAIL.  It is a list of every strain sent:  transaction number, strain name, lab code, lab member requesting it, date sent, whether there is a fee or not, invoice/order number, date invoice was sent, and comments.

We use this data to determine how many strains were sent, how many labs received strains, the number of orders sent, number of times a strain was sent, etc. for a given period.
